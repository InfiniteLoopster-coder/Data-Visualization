1. Overview of Matplotlib and Seaborn
In Matplotlib
Foundation Library: Matplotlib is the foundational Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Flexibility: It provides a low-level interface that gives you full control over every aspect of your plots.
Customization: You can finely tune plot elements such as axes, ticks, labels, legends, and styles.

Seaborn
Statistical Visualizations: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and is designed for statistical data visualization.
Simpler Syntax: It offers a high-level interface to create visually attractive plots with less code.
Themes & Color Palettes: Seaborn comes with built-in themes and color palettes to improve the aesthetics of your plots by default.

2. Bar Plots

In Matplotlib
Basic Bar Plot: Use plt.bar() for vertical bars or plt.barh() for horizontal bars.
Customization Options:
Error Bars: Add error bars using the yerr or xerr parameters.
Bar Colors: Customize colors for different bars.
Annotations: Use plt.text() to annotate bars with values.

In Seaborn
Using barplot: Seaborn’s barplot() function is great for showing the mean and confidence intervals.

3. Histograms

In Matplotlib
Basic Histogram: Use plt.hist() to create histograms.
Customization Options:
Bins: Specify the number of bins to control granularity.
Density: Use density=True to show probability density rather than count.
Transparency: Adjust transparency with the alpha parameter.

In Seaborn
Using histplot: Seaborn’s histplot() provides additional features like kernel density estimates (KDE).

4. Heatmaps

In Matplotlib
Basic Heatmap: While Matplotlib doesn’t have a dedicated heatmap function, you can use plt.imshow() or plt.pcolor() for creating one.
Customization Options:
Color Map: Choose a color map using the cmap parameter.
Annotations: Use plt.text() to annotate cells if needed.

In Seaborn
Using heatmap: Seaborn’s heatmap() function makes it easy to create annotated and beautifully styled heatmaps.
Customization Options:
Annotations: Use the annot=True parameter to show cell values.
Color Maps and Centering: Easily adjust with parameters like cmap and center.
